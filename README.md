# 📌 ONNX YOLOv8 Android Object Detection App

*A real-time object detection Android application powered by YOLOv8 and ONNX Runtime.*

---

## 🌐 Project Overview

This Android application demonstrates object detection using a YOLOv8 model exported to ONNX format. It takes an image input, runs inference with ONNX Runtime, and displays results with bounding boxes, class labels, and confidence scores.

### ✅ Highlights

- Works offline – no network dependency.
- Lightweight and mobile-optimized.
- Extensible and cleanly structured codebase.

---

## ✨ Key Features

### 🔍 YOLOv8 Inference (ONNX)
- Loads and executes a YOLOv8n model in ONNX format.
- Runs inference with efficient mobile performance via ONNX Runtime.

### 🖼️ Image Processing
- **Preprocessing**: Resize to 640×640, normalize to `[0, 1]` range.
- **Postprocessing**: Applies confidence filtering and Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS).

### 🧠 Detection Output
- Draws bounding boxes with class names and confidence values.
- Supports dynamic class names from `labels.txt`.

### 📱 Android Optimized
- Designed for Android 7.0+ (API 24+).
- Uses native bitmap processing for visualization.
